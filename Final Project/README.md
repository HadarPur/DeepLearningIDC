# Breast Cancer detection

Submitted as final project report for the Deep Learning course, IDC, 2020

Cancer is a fatal illness often caused by genetic disorder aggregation and a va- riety of pathological changes. Cancerous cells are abnormal areas often growing in any part of human body that are life-threatening. Cancer also known as tu- mor must be quickly and correctly detected in the initial stage to identify what might be beneficial for its cure. Even though modality has different considera- tions, such as complicated history, improper diagnostics and treatment that are main causes of deaths. The first goal of the project is to detect breast cancer using deep learning technique. Second goal of the project was to train a Neural network on breast cancer and check how it affect on the performance of other type of cancer. Finally, challenges are also highlighted for possible future work.

We will try to detect Breast cancer from data set by implementing CNN. First,we will try to improve the performance of the net by changing the number of layers and the parameters itself. Second, we would like to check if a trained net can perform better results for other type of cancer.

the following images represent each class from the data set:
